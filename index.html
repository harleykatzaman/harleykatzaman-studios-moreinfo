<h1> this is were i will tell you about how i made the website you were just on.
    i made this site only using html and css the coding is not hard if you know what you are doing.
    manny people assume that typeing code is hard but thanks to scratch when i learn to code in sertin languages
    i already havean idea on how it works learning html css and javascript had alot in common to what i had coded in scratch
    you know those make your own blocks?
    that was you making a function in javascript!
    what about drawing costumes in costume editer?
    that was basicly html and css!
    you will be surprized how easy it is to learn something in html/js/css.</h1>
